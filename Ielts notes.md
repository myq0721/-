Some people think that young people should spend free time with families instead of outside entertainment, others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 【NEW】

**参考论点**

1. family bonding is crucial for the development of strong relationships and a sense of belonging. 
家庭纽带对于发展牢固的关系和归属感至关重要。

2. spending time with families allows young people to gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage and traditions.

4. excessive emphasis on family time might hinder their personal growth and limit exposure to diverse experiences.

**参考范文**
There are differing opinions on how young people should spend their free time. On one hand, some argue that young people should prioritize spending time with their families over engaging in outside entertainment activities. They believe that family bonding is crucial for the development of strong relationships and a sense of
belonging. By spending quality time with their families, young people can foster emotional connections and receive guidance from their parents or older family
members.

Moreover, proponents of this view argue that spending time with families allows young people to gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage and traditions.
Through family activities, such as storytelling, cooking, or celebrating festivals together, young people can learn about their roots and develop a strong sense of identity. This connection to their culture can contribute to their overall well-being and provide a solid foundation for their personal growth.

On the other hand, there are those who believe that young people should have the freedom to engage in outside entertainment activities during their free time. They argue that participation in hobbies, sports, and socializing with friends outside the family circle promotes individuality and independence. These activities allow young people to explore their interests, develop new skills, and build their own network of relationships beyond the confines of their immediate family.

Furthermore, opponents of the notion that young people should primarily spend time with their families argue that excessive emphasis on family time might hinder their personal growth and limit exposure to diverse experiences. Outside entertainment, such as visiting museums, exploring nature, or attending cultural events, can expand their horizons, foster creativity, and promote socialization with peers outside the familial context. These experiences can enhance their critical thinking abilities and broaden their perspectives on the world.

In my opinion, a balance between spending time with families and engaging in outside entertainment is ideal for young people. Family bonds are undoubtedly important, as they provide a support system and valuable life lessons. However, young people also need the opportunity to explore their individual interests and develop their own identities. Therefore, a combination of quality family time and outside entertainment would allow for holistic personal and social development, ensuring young people grow into well-rounded individuals.

##### 2.对比学习商业与历史好处

Some people think that there could be more benefits to society if more people study business than history. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 【NEW】

**参考论点**
1. studying history offers numerous benefits to society. 学习历史为社会带来许多好处

2. By studying business, individuals are better prepared to establish successful enterprises. 通过学习商业，个人为建立成功的企业做好了更好的准备

3. it develops individuals' critical thinking abilities and provides a deeper understanding of societal evolution. 它培养了个人的批判性思维能力，并提供了对社会演变的更深入理解。

**参考范文**
The role of education in shaping individuals and society is undeniably important. While some argue that studying history offers numerous benefits to society, I firmly believe that focusing on business education can bring about greater advantages for societal progress. In this essay, I will outline the reasons behind this viewpoint and explain why studying business holds more value compared to history.

One of the primary reasons why studying business is beneficial for society is its direct link to economic prosperity. A strong foundation in business equips individuals with skills such as entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and management expertise. These skills play a crucial role in enhancing productivity, boosting innovation, and fostering sustainable economic development. By studying business, individuals are better prepared to establish successful enterprises, which in turn leads to job creation,improved living standards, and overall economic growth.

In today's rapidly changing world, societies face various complex challenges such as climate change, inequality, and technological advancements. Businesses have a significant role to play in addressing these issues. Through studying business,individuals gain the knowledge and tools required to develop innovative solutions.For instance, studies in sustainable business practices can pave the way for environmentally friendly initiatives, while courses focused on social entrepreneurship can tackle social issues effectively. Therefore, prioritizing business education will empower individuals to actively engage in creating a more sustainable and equitable society.

Studying business offers practical skills that are highly valued in the job market. Businesses are the backbone of societies, and individuals with relevant expertise are in high demand across various industries. Furthermore, business education emphasizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication skills, which are transferable abilities applicable to multiple fields. By equipping individuals with these practical skills, more doors open for career opportunities, enabling individuals to contribute meaningfully to society through employment and entrepreneurship.

Advocates of studying history may argue that it develops individuals' critical thinking abilities and provides a deeper understanding of societal evolution. While this is valid, it is important to recognize that business education also fosters critical thinking skills through case studies, analysis, and decision-making exercises. Moreover, the impacts of studying business are more directly observable within the context of societal progress, as it encompasses a broader range of contemporary challenges and opportunities.

Undoubtedly, both history and business education offer unique benefits to individuals and society. However, considering the practical applicability, economic impact, and ability to address contemporary challenges, I firmly believe that studying business outweighs the benefits of studying history in terms of contributing to societal development and progress. By equipping individuals with business-oriented knowledge and skills, we can forge a brighter future that promotes economic growth, sustainability, and a better quality of life for all.

##### 3.个人隐私

Today more people put personal and private information online to do everyday activities such as banking, shopping, and socializing. Is this a positive or negative development？【NEW】

**参考论点**
1. One of the main advantages of putting personal information online is the convenience it offers. 将个人信息放在网上的主要优点之一是它提供的便利。

2. the increased reliance on online platforms means a higher risk of privacy breaches and cybercrime. 对在线平台的依赖增加意味着隐私泄露和网络犯罪的风险更高。

3. the collection and analysis of personal data by corporations and governments have raised concerns about surveillance and infringement of individual privacy. 公司和政府对个人数据的收集和分析引起了对监视和侵犯个人隐私的担忧。

**参考范文**
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people who choose to put their personal and private information online for everyday activities such as banking, shopping, and socializing. This trend has sparked a debate regarding whether it is a positive or negative development. In my opinion, while there are certain advantages to this practice, the potential risks and concerns associated with online information sharing outweigh the benefits.

One of the main advantages of putting personal information online is the convenience it offers. With just a few clicks, individuals can access their bank accounts, make purchases, and connect with others around the world. This has undoubtedly made our lives easier and more efficient. Moreover, online platforms often provide enhanced security measures such as encryption and two-factor authentication, which aim to protect users' sensitive information.

On the other hand, there are several negative aspects to consider. First and foremost, the increased reliance on online platforms means a higher risk of privacy breaches and cybercrime. Hackers and identity thieves are constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, and even the most robust security measures can be compromised. Once personal information is leaked, the consequences can be severe, including financial loss, identity theft, and even blackmail.

Furthermore, the collection and analysis of personal data by corporations and governments have raised concerns about surveillance and infringement of individual privacy. As our online activities generate massive amounts of data, companies can use this information to target advertisements, manipulate consumer behavior, and make decisions that may affect individuals' lives without their knowledge or consent. This lack of transparency and control over personal information is worrisome and can lead to a loss of trust in online platforms.

In conclusion, while the convenience of putting personal and private information online for everyday activities is undeniable, the potential risks and concerns associated with this practice cannot be ignored. It is crucial for individuals, organizations, and policymakers to strike a balance between convenience and privacy protection. This can be achieved through the implementation of robust security measures, strict regulations on data collection and usage, and continuous efforts to raise awareness about online risks. Only then can we truly harness the benefits of the digital world while safeguarding our personal information.

**参考作文**
In recent years, people around the world have been enjoying longer life spans due to advancements in healthcare and living conditions. While this increased life expectancy is undoubtedly positive development, it also brings about various implications for both individuals and society as a whole.

Firstly, longer life expectancy has a significant impact on individuals themselves. On a personal level, individuals have more time to pursue their goals, dreams, and personal interests. With extended life spans, people can engage in lifelong learning, continue working, or embark on new careers. This prolonged period of productivity and engagement can lead to higher levels of personal fulfillment and satisfaction.

However, individuals with longer life expectancy are likely to require additional financial resources to sustain their livelihoods during their extended years. With retirement often starting later and lasting longer, individuals may need to save more and plan better to ensure financial security throughout their golden years. This increased financial burden can place additional strain on individuals and families, as well as on social support systems.

Moving on to the societal implications, an aging population resulting from longer life expectancy presents both challenges and opportunities for societies. On the one hand, there will be a growing demand for healthcare services, long-term care facilities, and other forms of support for elderly citizens. This can create a strain on healthcare systems, social welfare programs, and pension schemes. Governments and societies will need to adjust their policies and allocate appropriate resources to meet these needs.

On the other hand, a longer life span also brings potential benefits to society. The knowledge and experience of older individuals can be tapped into, leading to intergenerational learning and knowledge transfer. Older adults can contribute to the workforce and the economy for extended periods, promoting economic growth and stability. Moreover, societies can benefit from the wisdom and guidance of older individuals in decision-making processes, leading to more balanced and inclusive policies.

In conclusion, longer life expectancy has wide-ranging effects on both individuals and society. While individuals can enjoy extended periods of productivity and personal fulfillment, they also face financial challenges. Societies will need to adapt to address the increased demand for healthcare and social support, but can also benefit from the contributions of older individuals. Ultimately, the implications of longer life expectancy call for comprehensive planning and policies to ensure well-being for all ages within societies.

2. Zoos play a critical role in educating the public about wildlife conservation and animal behavior.（在教育公众野生动物保护和动物行为方面起着至关重要的作用）

Negative:

2. Living in unnatural environments can cause animals to suffer psychological or physical harm.（生活在非自然环境可能导致动物产生心理或身体上的伤害）

3. Many zoos use animals as entertainment for profit.（很多动物园出于利润而将动物作为娱乐目的）

**参考范文**
Zoos have always been a topic of debate among people. While some believe that zoos are cruel and should be closed, others argue that they play a crucial role in protecting rare and endangered animals. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion.

On the one hand, those who oppose zoos argue that animals should not be kept in captivity. They believe that it is cruel to confine animals to small enclosures and deprive them of their freedom. Furthermore, animals in zoos are often subjected to physical and psychological distress due to the unnatural environments they are forced to live in. Moreover, critics argue that zoos prioritize profit over animal welfare, and animals are often exploited for entertainment purposes.

On the other hand, supporters of zoos argue that they provide a safe environment for endangered animals. Zoos offer protection and care for animals that are facing extinction due to habitat destruction, poaching, and other threats. In addition, zoos play a critical role in educating the public about wildlife conservation and animal behavior. Zoos also contribute to scientific research and breeding programs, which are essential for the survival of some endangered species.

In my opinion, while there are some valid arguments against zoos, I believe that they
 are necessary for the protection and conservation of rare and endangered animals.
 However, zoos should be regulated and monitored to ensure that animal welfare is
 prioritized over profit. Zoos should also focus on education and scientific research,
 rather than solely on entertainment.
 In conclusion, the debate over zoos will continue. However, I believe that zoos can be
 a valuable tool for conservation and education if they are managed correctly. We must
 find a balance between animal welfare and conservation efforts to ensure the survival
 of endangered species.

3. Children may feel a lack of control over their lives.（孩子们可能会感到对自己的生活缺乏控制）
  
**参考范文**
In recent years, there has been an increasing trend for parents to put pressure on their children to achieve academic success. This is largely due to the belief that academic success is the key to a good career and a comfortable life. Parents feel that they must do everything they can to ensure their children have the best possible start in life.

However, this can have negative consequences for children. The pressure to succeed can be overwhelming and cause feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and even depression. The constant focus on achieving academic success can also lead to neglect of other important areas of a child's life, such as their relationships with family and friends, physical health, and personal interests. Furthermore, children may feel a lack of control over their lives, leading to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness.

On the other hand, some argue that a certain amount of pressure can be positive and motivate children to work harder and achieve their goals. It can also help children to develop important life skills such as time management, resilience, and determination.

In my opinion, while some pressure can be motivating, parents need to be careful not to put too much pressure on their children. Parents should encourage their children to work hard and strive for success, but they should also emphasise the importance of a balanced lifestyle and encourage their children to pursue interests and hobbies outside of school. Parents should also be aware of their child's mental health and seek professional help if necessary.

有些人认为男人和女人有不同的品质。因此，有些工作适合男性，有些工作适合
女性。你在多大程度上同意或不同意?
  
**参考论点**
Agree:
1. Certain jobs are better suited for one gender is that men and women have different physical abilities（男性和女性的身体能力不同）
2. Different genders have different career preferences and psychological characteristics（不同性别有不同的职业偏好和心理特征）
  
Disagree:
1. Many jobs require skills and abilities that are not specific to one gender or the other.（许多工作所需要的技能和能力并不局限于某一性别）
2. The idea that men and women have different qualities and are better suited for certain jobs can lead to discrimination and inequality.（更适合某些工作的想法会导
致歧视和不平等）
  
**参考范文**
In recent years, the discussion about whether certain jobs are more suitable for men or women has become a topic of debate. Some people argue that men and women have different qualities and that certain jobs should be reserved for one gender or the other.Others believe that people should be able to pursue any career regardless of gender.

In my opinion, the idea that men and women have different qualities and are better suited for certain jobs is outdated and unfair. One argument for the idea that certain jobs are better suited for one gender is that men and women have different physical abilities. For example, men are generally stronger than women, so they may be more suited for jobs that require physical labor. Similarly, women are often viewed as being more nurturing, so they may be better suited for jobs that involve caring for others, such as nursing or teaching.

However, this argument overlooks the fact that many jobs require skills and abilities
that are not specific to one gender or the other. For example, both men and women can be good leaders, good communicators, and good problem solvers. In fact, research has shown that having a diverse workforce that includes both men and women can
lead to better outcomes for businesses and organizations. 
  
Furthermore, the idea that men and women have different qualities and are better suited for certain jobs can lead to discrimination and inequality. If certain jobs are seen as being "for men" or "for women," then people who do not conform to those gender norms may be excluded from those jobs or face discrimination in the workplace. This can limit opportunities for individuals and lead to a less diverse and less productive workforce.

In conclusion, I believe that the idea that certain jobs are better suited for men or women is outdated and unfair. People should be able to pursue any career they are
interested in regardless of gender. By promoting equality and diversity in the workplace, we can create a more inclusive and productive society.

4. may do harm to interpersonal relationships if people concentrate solely on the goals (如果只关注目标，可能伤害到人际关系)

**参考范文**
Which is it? A positive inner quality that favours both individuals and the society as a whole? Or an outcome that we are reluctant to see? The spread of competitiveness in people’s attitudes towards their lives and the world is making the public confused. 

Competitiveness or ambition, as an inner quality of an individual, plays two contradictory roles in the life of a modern individual. On the one hand, people with a strong desire for success stand a much better chance of final achievement, as they are often more motivated to obtain skills and strategies they need and more readily
prepared for opportunities. On the other hand, an overemphasis on outcomes may also make people suffer, based on the fact that failures are unavoidable, and their desire for success may finally turn into mental pressure that damages their confidence.
  
On a social level, the picture seems much rosier. After all, if more and more people become motivated and make their best in daily jobs, the products and services that we can enjoy would become significantly improved. Ultimately, though, there are still some questions to ask, such as does the improvement of material lives really enhance our happiness when it places extra pressure on every one of us; or is it really positive given that it might give rise to unfair competitions?
  
In conclusion, competitiveness or people's ambition is obviously an important personal quality. But only when it is restricted to a healthy level does it exert positive influence on us. In addition, the effectiveness of the trend more and more people are ambitious to enhance our material lives should also be identified, while it is still questionable whether this improves our sense of happiness.

The prosperity of market economy and the improvement of telecommunication allow a growing number of companies to publicize their products through advertisements. In this case, how to evaluate the pros and cons of advertising is under discussion. Although it may sometimes mislead some consumers, in my opinion, its benefits should be highlighted.

To begin with, advertisements enable consumers to make well-informed decisions on purchasing goods. Much information is provided through advertisements, such as materials, prices, functions and so on. Therefore, it is possible for consumers to learn about what they are going to purchase in detail, and they are able to know whether the goods are suitable. 

In addition, manufacturers are capable of employing the advertisements to promote
their products. It is undeniable that advertising is increasingly effective in terms of sales promotion. Celebrity endorsement is a good case in point. For instance, many sports stores and companies invite famous players to endorse their newly-developed sneakers, so the followers, in order to support their idols, are more willing to buy such advertised goods, which would also give them an illusion that they are similar to these athletes; therefore the sales of these commodities could increase.
  
Advertisements, on the other hand, sometimes convey the inaccurate information and push those who are insensible to purchase unnecessary items. It is possible that there are some exaggerations and excessive publicity in the advertisements. However, it can be solved if related divisions impose the regulation on the advertising industry. 

In conclusion, I do believe advertisements provide the chance for consumers to make reasonable purchasing decisions and for producers to promote their merchandises, and finally, efforts should be made to refuse fake and misleading advertising.

**参考范文**
Public transportation plays a crucial role in urban development, ensuring efficient mobility for citizens. However, a debate arises regarding whether governments should prioritize investing in faster public transportation or allocate resources to address other pressing issues. This essay will examine both viewpoints and offer a balanced perspective.

Advocates argue that investing in faster public transportation yields numerous benefits. Firstly, an efficient transit system reduces commuting time, easing congestion and improving productivity. Shorter travel times also enhance the quality of life by allowing individuals to spend more time with their families or engage in recreational activities. Additionally, fast and reliable public transportation attracts more users, leading to increased revenue for the government. Finally, investing in public transportation helps reduce carbon emissions, contributing to a greener environment and combatting climate change.
  
On the other hand, some argue that there are equally important priorities that warrant government attention. For instance, healthcare, education, and social welfare require significant financial investment to ensure the well-being and development of citizens. Neglecting these areas can lead to adverse societal consequences, including increased inequality and a lack of opportunities for vulnerable communities. Moreover, allocating funds towards environmental conservation and renewable energy initiatives is crucial in addressing climate change and preserving natural resources.
  
While it is essential to invest in faster public transportation, governments should strike a balance between different priorities. A comprehensive approach is necessary to address the needs of citizens holistically. Adequate funding for healthcare, education, and social welfare programs is vital for a prosperous society. At the same time, allocating resources towards eco-friendly infrastructure and renewable energy projects aligns with sustainable development goals.

Furthermore, governments should explore ways to optimize existing transportation systems before considering introducing expensive high-speed networks. Upgrading existing infrastructure, improving reliability, and implementing smart technologies can make public transportation faster and more efficient without incurring substantial costs.

In conclusion, while faster public transportation offers significant benefits, governments must carefully consider competing priorities. Investment in public healthcare, education, social welfare, and environmental conservation should not be overlooked. Striking a balance and adopting a comprehensive approach will contribute to the overall well-being and sustainable development of a nation. Only by considering diverse needs can governments truly cater to the demands of its population.

Vehicle-freedays,duringwhichprivatecars, trucks, andmotorcyclesareprohibited
 incitycentersandpeopleareencouragedtousepublictransportationlikebuses,taxis,

and subways, have become increasingly popular in some cities. This essay will
 discuss the advantages and disadvantages of implementing vehicle-free days and
 determine whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
  
One of the main advantages of vehicle-free days is the reduction in air pollution.
 Private cars and motorcycles are major contributors to air pollution, releasing harmful
 emissions such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides. By limiting their use on
 designated days, these emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to improved air
 quality and a healthier environment for city dwellers.
  
Moreover, vehicle-free days promote the use of sustainable modes of transportation.
 Public transportations like buses, taxis, and subways are more energy-efficient and
 emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to private vehicles. Encouraging people to
 rely on these modes of transport can help reduce traffic congestion and alleviate the
 ecological footprint associated with individual car ownership.
  
  
Additionally, vehicle-free days create opportunities for active lifestyles. With private
 cars restricted, more people may opt to travel on foot or by bicycle. This not only
 reduces carbon emissions but also promotes physical activity, leading to better health
 outcomes for residents. Furthermore, it can enhance the livability of cities by creating
 pedestrian-friendly spaces that are conducive to walking, socializing, and outdoor
 activities.
  
However, there are also certain disadvantages to consider. Firstly, vehicle-free days
 may inconvenience those who heavily rely on private cars for daily commuting or
 transportation purposes. Some individuals may find it difficult to adjust to alternative
 modes of transport, especially if the public transportation system is inadequate or
 unreliable in certain areas. This could lead to increased travel times and potential
 productivity losses.
 Secondly, businesses in city centers may suffer as a result of vehicle-free days.
 Restrictions on private vehicles may deter customers from visiting shops, restaurants,
 and other establishments located in these areas. This could negatively impact local
 businesses and the overall economy of the city.
 In conclusion, vehicle-free days offer several benefits such as reduced air pollution,
 and promotion of sustainable transportation. However, there are also drawbacks,
 including inconvenience for daily commuters and potential negative effects on local
 businesses. Taking these factors into account, it can be argued that the advantages of
 implementing vehicle-free days outweigh the disadvantages, considering the
 long-term environmental and health benefits they bring to cities.

 **参考范文**
Traffic congestion and transportation problems are a growing concern in many urban
 areas. Some people believe that encouraging people to live in cities is the best way to
 address these issues, while others argue that this approach is not feasible or effective.
 On one hand, advocates of living in cities argue that concentrating people in urban
 areas would reduce the need for cars and decrease traffic congestion. This is because
 public transportation systems are typically better developed in urban areas, making it
 easier for people to get around without relying on cars. Furthermore, when people live
 in cities, they are more likely to walk or bike to work, reducing the need for motor
 vehicles altogether.
 On the other hand, those who oppose this viewpoint argue that it may not be feasible
 for all people to dwell in cities. Cities are often more expensive to live in, so that not
 everyone can afford the high cost of living associated with urban areas. Encouraging
 44

people to live in cities may also put a strain on existing infrastructure and services,
 leading to further congestion and other problems.
  
In my opinion, the best way to solve traffic and transportation problems is to
 encourage a mix of solutions that address the needs of all residents, regardless of their
 location. This may include improving public transportation systems, developing
 carpooling initiatives, and promoting the use of bicycles and walking paths.
 Additionally, local governments can explore options such as flexi-hours or remote
 work arrangements to reduce the number of people commuting during peak hours.
 Ultimately, a combination of measures will be required to effectively tackle
 transportation problems and improve quality of life for all residents.

 **参考范文**
Overpopulation, despite the economic boom and rapid development of urbanisation,
 has been particularly obvious in metropolises, and this has imposed great pressure on
 the urban housing and traffic. In order to tackle such problems, some countries have
 implemented policies to relocate businesses to the countryside. This action, I believe,
 will be an effective solution.
 On the one hand, the relocation of businesses to remote areas is helpful to reducing
 house price and relieving traffic pressure. To illustrate, most big cities are often very
 crowed with large population and limited resources. If some factories move to the
 countryside, this means that there will be fewer people living in the city, and the rental
 demand for accommodation in the meanwhile will also be decreased, so the house
 price is predicted to go down when there is more room available. Meanwhile, the
 traffic congestion will also be alleviated because the number of commuters to and
 from work every day is now smaller. For example, the traffic condition in Beijing
 becomes much better after some large industrial factories are encouraged to move to
 peripheral suburbs.
 On the other hand, some problems may arise if companies move to the countryside,
 47

and the most obvious one is that the rural area is generally backward in transportation
 and communication systems, which may cause a lot of inconveniences for these
 companies. However, when it is seen in the long run, it is an unnecessary worry,
 because transportation will be enhanced when more factories come and settle down.
  
Overall, although there may be inconvenient transportation and communication if
 businesses move to the country area in the initial age, I believe it is worth trying
 because it does have effects on dealing with the traffic and housing problems in cities.

 **参考范文**
In today's rapidly changing world, the role of schools is often debated. Some argue
 that their main purpose should be to transform children into good citizens and workers,
 while others believe that schools should primarily focus on benefiting them as
 individuals. In my opinion, while it is essential for schools to instill societal values
 and nurture professional skills, their core objective should still be the overall
 development and well-being of each student.
 On the one hand, schools play a crucial role in preparing young individuals for their
 future roles in society. By teaching subjects like history, civics, and ethics, schools
 aim to create responsible and engaged citizens who are aware of their rights, duties,
 and the importance of civic participation. Additionally, vocational training equips
 students with practical skills and knowledge necessary for their future careers.
 Therefore, schools provide the foundations for economic productivity and societal
 cohesion.
 50

On the other hand, schools should not neglect the individual needs and aspirations of
 their students. Each child possesses unique talents, interests, and potential, which
 should be nurtured and harnessed. A well-rounded education should go beyond
 academic achievements and embrace personal growth, emotional intelligence, and
 creativity. By encouraging self-expression, critical thinking, and problem-solving
 abilities, schools can help students explore their true potential and develop into
 fulfilled and confident individuals.
  
  
Moreover, taking a student-centered approach benefits not only the individual but also
 society as a whole. When students are supported in following their passions and
 interests, they become more motivated and engaged in their studies. This ultimately
 leads to higher levels of achievement and innovation. By promoting personal
 development alongside citizenship and work skills, schools foster a sense of purpose
 and intrinsic motivation within students, enabling them to contribute positively to
 their communities.
  
  
In conclusion, while it is important to acknowledge the role of schools in shaping
 good citizens and workers, their primary purpose should be to benefit students as
 individuals. A balanced education that encompasses personal growth alongside
 academic and vocational training will not only serve the needs of society but also
 create well-rounded and fulfilled individuals who are prepared to tackle the
 challenges of the future. Thus, schools should strive to achieve a harmonious blend of
 societal and individual-focused education.

In recent times, the role of a university education in achieving success in life has been
 a topic of debate. While some individuals argue that obtaining a university degree is
 the key to success, others contend that this perception is no longer valid in today's
 society. This essay will examine both viewpoints and provide a personal opinion.
 On one hand, proponents of the idea that a university education is crucial for success
 argue that it equips individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in
 their chosen fields. Higher education provides students with a comprehensive
 understanding of subjects, allowing them to specialize and become experts in their
 respective areas. Moreover, universities often offer practical opportunities such as
 internships and research projects, enabling students to apply theoretical concepts in
 real-world scenarios. Additionally, a university degree is frequently regarded as a
 prerequisite by many employers, particularly in competitive industries.
 53

On the other hand, those who oppose the notion point out that there are alternative
 pathways to achieve one's goals. Some argue that practical experience and vocational
 training can be equally valuable, as they provide individuals with hands-on skills that
 are directly applicable to the workforce. For example, individuals pursuing careers in
 trades such as plumbing or electricians may not require a university degree, but rather
 technical training and certifications. Furthermore, entrepreneurship and self-education
 have become more accessible in recent years, with numerous successful individuals
 emerging without a formal university qualification.
  
  
In my opinion, while a university education can significantly contribute to success in
 life, it is not the sole determining factor. The value of higher education lies in its
 ability to foster critical thinking, creativity, and a broad understanding of the world.
 However, success is a multifaceted concept that cannot be solely attributed to
 academic credentials. Factors such as determination, perseverance, networking skills,
 and adaptability play equally important roles in achieving success.
  
In conclusion, the belief that a university education is the ultimate pathway to success
 is disputed by some individuals. While higher education undoubtedly provides
 valuable knowledge and opportunities, alternative paths can also lead to success in
 various fields. Ultimately, success is a result of a combination of factors, including
 personal attributes, experiences, and qualifications.

##### 3. 育儿导师必要性
3. Parents are trying to reach childcare tutors to learn how to take care of their
 children. Is this essential? Give your opinion on this and illustrate an example.
父母们正试图聘请育儿导师来学习如何照顾孩子，这是必要的吗?请给出你的观
点并举例说明。
  
 参考论点
  
Positive:
 1.Children need to have a comprehensive and scientific care.（孩子需要有一个全面
且科学的照顾）
2.avoid family conflicts caused by different parenting concepts（避免因育儿理念不
同导致的家庭冲突）
  
  
Negative:
 1. They can seek advice and guidance from other parents who have already gone
 through similar experiences.（可以向其他有过类似经历的父母寻求建议和指导）
2. Parenting books and articles can provide helpful tips and guidance.（育儿书籍和
文章可以提供有用的建议和指导）
  
 **参考范文**
In recent years, many parents have sought the assistance of childcare tutors to learn
 how to take care of their children. While this may be helpful in some cases, I do not
 believe that it is essential.
 While it is understandable that some parents may feel overwhelmed and uncertain
 about how to properly care for their children, it is important to note that there are
 many ways to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills without the help of a
 childcare tutor. One option is to seek advice and guidance from other parents who
 have already gone through similar experiences. This can be done through social media
 groups, community support groups, or simply by reaching out to friends and family
 who have children. Additionally, there are countless parenting books and articles
 available that can provide helpful tips and guidance.
 One example of this is a couple I know who have two children. Despite having no
 prior experience taking care of children, they were able to learn through trial and error
 and by seeking advice from other parents and resources. They read parenting books
 and joined online forums to get tips on everything from feeding to sleeping. They also
 56

made sure to spend quality time with their children, engaging in activities such as
 reading and playing games together. As a result of their efforts, their children have
 thrived and are happy and healthy.
 In conclusion, while childcare tutors may be helpful in some situations, I do not
 believe that they are essential for all parents. With experience and the support of
 available resources, parents can learn how to effectively care for their children.

4. Requiring students to pay the full cost of education may lead to unequal

 **参考范文**
In recent years, there has been a debate about whether university students should pay
 all the cost of their studies. Some people argue that since university education only
 benefits the individual students and not the society as a whole, they should pay the
 full cost of their education. However, I disagree with this view.
 Firstly, education is a public good that benefits society as a whole. The benefits of a
 university education extend beyond just the individual student. For example,
 university graduates can contribute to the economy through their work and pay taxes,
 which benefits society as a whole. Moreover, university research often leads to new
 innovations and discoveries that can have significant impacts on society.
 Secondly, the cost of university education is often too high for students to bear on
 their own. Many students come from low-income families and cannot afford to pay
 for their education. If students were required to pay the full cost of their education, it
 would create a barrier to higher education and limit opportunities for many people.
 59

Lastly, if students were required to pay the full cost of their education, it could lead to
 an unequal distribution of education. Wealthy families would be able to afford to send
 their children to university, while those from low-income families would be unable to
 do so. This would create a significant gap between the rich and the poor and limit
 social mobility.
  
  
In conclusion, I believe that university education is a public good that benefits society
 as a whole, and students should not be required to pay the full cost of their education.
 It is essential to invest in education to ensure that all individuals have equal
 opportunities to succeed and contribute to society.

 **参考范文**
  
With the rising popularity of the Internet and smart phone, students now have a much
 wider range of information channels to choose from than ever before. This specific
 development comes with mixed public reaction as to whether teachers have lost their
 importance in modern education. I firmly believe that there is still a crucial place for
 teachers in the current education system.

While most of the other information sources are usually circulated in one-way
 direction, meaning that students cannot interact with and get feedback from the
 sources, teachers can guide students face to face in real time. In a real classroom,
 teachers can immediately react to students’ performance, point out the good and bad
 and guide them to improve, which is much more effective than the Internet-based
 learning.
 More crucially, the exams that teachers need to pass in order to be certified ensure
 that in comparison with sources on the Internet, which is a mixed bag, qualified
 teachers can provide much more reliable knowledge. Many information sources are
 not held accountable for what they post on the Internet, so they are prone to promote
 misinformation for malicious objectives. In contrast, educational departments and
 schools can regulate and manage teachers so as to ensure that what they teach is in
 line with the educational benefit of students.
 Some might argue that students can get in touch with many professionals on the
 Internet, who can provide a much wider range of knowledge than teachers. This claim
 seems to hold water, but I believe that what matters most is the quality, instead of
 quantity, of information. As is reasoned above, teachers can provide more reliable
 educational information, thus even if what they offer is not as diversified as online
 sources, they still hold immense importance in modern education.

With more and more private schools providing education of higher quality and more
 diversity, many parents opt out of state education system and send their children to
 private schools instead. Many argue that these parents should not pay taxes that would
 be invested in state education systems and I totally disagree with them based on the
 following reasoning.
  
  
Everyone has to be taxed for public services that we may not use, such as public
 nursing homes and bus systems. These public services are essential for the optimal
 functioning of the entire society, so as responsible civil citizens, we need to pay taxes
 in order for the society to run as planned. The same goes for state education system,
 which is irreplaceable and crucial public service for many children who cannot afford
 private school expenses. Therefore, even if parents might never benefit from state
 education, they should pay tax for its development.
  
Moreover, tax strengthens financial support for state education system, which helps
 provide more equal opportunities for people. Public school could be the only school
 that many underprivileged children can afford to go to. With more high-quality public
 schools built up, more children can receive education and access the same opportunity
 that in the past only wealthy children can have. This can facilitate the creation of a
 more equal and fairer society.
  
  
Last but not least, if parents who send their children to private schools are exempt
 from tax for state education system, underprivileged families must be burdened with
 much heavier tax for the system. This might further worsen their financial situation
 and affect the academic future of many children.
 Based on the reasoning above, I firmly believe that it is an obligation for all families
 to pay tax for the development of state education system.

 **参考范文**
  
To win an athletic competition requires many preconditions. Some people think that
 sportsmen’s competency is the key to help them to get advantages more easily
 especially in matches that require higher skills and endurance. While others hold the
 view that attitude is more important because it determines one’s confidence and
 motivation. In my opinion, both elements lead to athletes’ success..
  
On the one hand, stronger bodies as well as outstanding skills enable sportsmen to
 have higher endurance. For example, if a competitor is strong enough to stay
 energetic in a long-lasting game, he/she will have more opportunities to defeat rivals.
 Moreover, sportsmen with higher competence show extraordinary explosive power in
 general so they are more likely to lead some intense games like 100-meter dash.
  
  
On the other hand, a good mental state is also important in matches because it can
 reduce nervousness and stress. It is undeniable that being too nervous will lead to
 misjudgments and mistakes. Besides, attitudes also have a huge impact on athletes’
 motivation during daily training. If they are positive, confident and hard-working
 when they are preparing for competitions, the efficiency of their training will be far
 more remarkable.
  
In my opinion, both physical and psychological factors contribute to satisfying results
 for our athletes. Even the strongest team can not win the game, if the team members
 do not have faith in themselves. They will be easily intimidated by their rivals and
 therefore fail to focus on their targets. Nevertheless, if athletes just have positivity or
 even arrogancy without being equipped with competence, then they will definitely fail
 too.

 **参考范文：**
In recent years, the issue of excessive packaging has drawn significant attention.
 While some individuals believe that manufacturers and shopping malls should reduce
 the amount of packaging used, others argue that consumers hold the responsibility to
 choose products with less packaging. This essay will discuss both perspectives and
 present my own opinion on the matter.
 On one hand, proponents of the former view assert that manufacturers and shopping
 malls should take proactive measures to minimize the use of packaging. They argue
 that excessive packaging not only contributes to environmental pollution but also
 wastes valuable resources. Moreover, reducing packaging can lead to more
 cost-effective production, thereby lowering the overall price of goods for consumers.
 By adopting eco-friendly and sustainable packaging practices, manufacturers and
 shopping malls can demonstrate their commitment towards environmental protection.
 71

On the other hand, supporters of the latter view contend that consumers should
 shoulder the responsibility of purchasing products with less packaging. They believe
 that individual choices have a significant impact on market demand and production
 patterns. By actively selecting products with minimal packaging or choosing
 alternative options such as refillable containers, consumers can promote sustainability
 and encourage manufacturers to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.
 Advocates of this viewpoint believe that consumer awareness and conscious
 decision-making hold the key to resolving the issue of excessive packaging.
  
  
In my opinion, it is essential to address the issue from both ends. Manufacturers and
 shopping malls have a crucial role to play in reducing excessive packaging. They
 should invest in research and development to explore sustainable packaging
 alternatives. Additionally, they can implement recycling and waste management
 systems to ensure proper disposal and minimize environmental harm. However,
 consumers also need to be educated and empowered to make responsible choices.
 Public awareness campaigns, incentives for eco-friendly purchases, and improved
 labeling can help individuals make informed decisions.
  
  
To conclude, while some argue that manufacturers and shopping malls should sell
 fewer packaged products, others maintain that individuals should take responsibility
 for choosing products with less packaging. In my view, both parties need to actively
 participate in tackling the issue of excessive packaging. By adopting sustainable
 practices and promoting consumer awareness, we can work towards a more
 environmentally friendly future.

 **参考范文**
  
More and more plastic waste is polluting the world's cities, countryside, and oceans,
 and this issue has become a pressing concern for the global community. The problem
 of plastic pollution is complex and multifaceted, and it poses a range of environmental,
 economic, and health problems.
  
Plastic waste has a negative impact on the environment in several ways. It can take
 hundreds of years for plastic to decompose, and when it does, it releases toxic
 chemicals into the environment. Plastic waste also poses a threat to marine life, as
 animals can mistake it for food and ingest it, causing injury or death. Additionally,
 plastic waste can clog drains, leading to flooding and other issues in cities.
  
  
To solve these problems, we need to take measures at both the individual and
 systemic levels. On an individual level, we can reduce our consumption of single-use
 plastic products, such as straws and plastic bags, and properly dispose of any plastic
 waste we do generate. On a systemic level, governments and businesses can work
 together to reduce the production and consumption of plastic, encourage the use of
 eco-friendly alternatives, and invest in waste management infrastructure.
  
Governments can also incentivise businesses to reduce their plastic use and hold them
 accountable for their environmental impact. This can be done through taxes, fees, or
 regulations that penalize companies that produce excessive plastic waste or fail to
 properly dispose of it. Moreover, public awareness campaigns can educate people
 about the importance of reducing plastic use and how to dispose of it properly.
 In conclusion, the plastic waste problem is a global issue that requires both individual
 and systemic solutions. By taking action to reduce our plastic consumption and
 properly dispose of any plastic waste, we can all contribute to a cleaner and healthier
 planet.

It is an undeniable fact that throughout the progress of human society’s development,
 we have been damaging the environment to different extent. Some argue that this is an
 inevitable consequence, whereas others dispute the opinion. Personally, I see damages
 to the environment as an unavoidable cost when improving our living standard.
  
  
The entire progress of improving our living standard is immensely resource-intensive,
 so damages to the environment are inevitable. Take expanding house constructions to
 improve living environment as an example. Governments have to exploit an extensive
 swath of land for the space to construct houses. This could mean a large scale of
 deforestation. House construction also involves the exploitation of an incredible
 amount of natural resources, including wood, steel and water. The construction
 process might also produce toxic gas that results in air pollution. The same can be said
 of many other essential industries to make our lives better.
  
In order to mitigate damages to the environment while keeping up the level of our
 living standard, we must develop very cutting-edge technology to protect our
 environment. Unfortunately, the current level of human technology is not up to that
 par yet. That is to say, in order to limit the damages to environment, we might need to
 hold back the progress of improving living standard before some revolutionary
 technologies come up in the future.
 In conclusion, we should not do whatever we want with the natural environment just
 to keep improving living standard. Some of the damages could be irreversible in the
 long-term future and they might end up significantly reversing our progress of social
 development. Hence, the advisable approach going forward would strike a balance
 between environmental protection and social advancement.

Environmental pollution has posed grave challenges for our society and who should
 be financially accountable for these problems has evoked a heated public debate.
 Some argue that instead of governments, corporations and individuals that produce
 pollutions should pay to solve the problem. I strongly agree with this idea.
  
The root of environmental pollutions can always be traced back to irresponsible
 corporations and individuals. In the pursuit of maximized profits, many corporations
 use fuels that are not environmentally friendly to manufacture products, resulting in
 serious air pollutions. Many individuals pour dirty water into rivers simply for
 convenience. When corporations and individuals collectively conduct these
 irresponsible and damaging behaviors, consequences could be catastrophic for the
 environment. Since they are responsible for this problem, they should pay to alleviate
 pollution.
 If corporations and individuals are required to pay for environmental problems that
 they have caused, they are more likely to be deterred from polluting the environment
 in the future. When there is a high price to pay, people are going to think twice before
 taking actions that may damage the environment as their benefits are at stake.
 Meanwhile, this approach can also raise environmental consciousness among
 corporations and individuals. As they are accountable for pollutions, they are likely to
 be driven to think deeply about how their behaviors affect the environment. When
 people are aware of the importance of environmental protection, pollution can be
 curbed in the long term.

 **参考范文：**
In today's digital era, individuals have various choices for entertainment, including
 reading books and watching TV. This essay aims to discuss the extent to which
 reading for pleasure can develop imagination and language skills more effectively
 than watching TV.
 Reading books is an exceptional avenue for nurturing and enhancing one's
 imagination. When engrossed in a novel or story, readers are required to create vivid
 mental images of characters, settings, and events. This imaginative process helps
  
readers develop critical cognitive abilities, leading to advanced creative thinking skills.
 On the other hand, watching TV often provides visual content that does not require
 active imagination, limiting the development of this crucial aspect of the mind.
 Reading extensively exposes individuals to a diverse range of vocabulary, syntax, and
 writing styles. Through reading, individuals encounter words and phrases in various
 contexts, enabling them to grasp their nuanced meanings. Additionally, exposure to
 well-written literature significantly aids in improving grammar and sentence structure,
 facilitating overall language fluency. Conversely, watching TV, despite offering
 audio-visual stimuli, usually simplifies language usage and often utilizes colloquial
 dialogues that may hinder language learning.
 Reading goes beyond language development; it also expands knowledge and fosters
 critical thinking. Books allow individuals to explore different cultures, historical
 events, and complex themes. Readers are required to analyze ideas, evaluate
 characters' motivations, and interpret subtexts. Consequently, reading for pleasure
 provides a platform for intellectual growth, whereas TV tends to supply information
 in a passive manner, limiting critical thinking opportunities.
 Critics may argue that watching TV can also promote imagination and language skills
 through dramas, documentaries, and educational programs. While this is true to some
 extent, these benefits are often outweighed by the passive nature of TV consumption.
 Additionally, the convenience of visual stimuli on TV can detract from active mental
 engagement compared to the imaginative process triggered by reading.
 In conclusion, reading for pleasure surpasses watching TV in developing imagination
 and language skills. By engaging readers in an active imaginative process and
 providing exposure to diverse vocabulary and writing styles, books offer a distinct
 advantage. Furthermore, reading promotes experiential learning and critical thinking,
 contributing to personal growth and intellectual development. Therefore, individuals
 are encouraged to prioritize reading to fully harness these benefits over the more
 passive act of watching TV.

 **参考范文**
Culture is a broad term that encompasses language, customs, traditions, beliefs, and
 values of a particular group of people. Language is undoubtedly a fundamental
 element of culture, and many people believe that learning a language is the best way
 to understand and appreciate a culture. While I agree that learning the language of a
 culture can provide a deeper understanding of it, I also believe that other ways can be
 just as effective.
 One of the advantages of learning a language is that it allows one to communicate
 directly with people from that culture. Speaking the language of a culture enables a
 person to express their thoughts and feelings more effectively and to understand the
 perspectives and experiences of others. Moreover, learning a language can also help
  
individuals appreciate the nuances and subtleties of a culture's literature, music, and
 art, which are often only fully comprehensible in the language in which they are
 created.
 However, learning a language is not the only way to gain insight into a culture.
 Traveling to a country and immersing oneself in its daily life can also provide a deep
 understanding of the culture. By experiencing the customs, traditions, and daily
 routines of a culture firsthand, one can gain a unique perspective that cannot be
 obtained through language learning alone. Similarly, reading books, watching
 documentaries, and attending cultural events can also help individuals understand a
 culture in a meaningful way.
 In conclusion, I agree that learning the language of a culture is an essential way to
 learn about it, but it is not the only way. Other methods, such as traveling, reading,
 and attending cultural events, can also provide valuable insights. Therefore,
 individuals should use a combination of these approaches to gain a deeper
 understanding of a culture.

 **参考范文**
There is a mixed feeling toward international competitive sports among the public.
 Some argue that it sparks and escalates conflicts among different groups, while others
 believe that it facilitates understanding between different groups and push forward
 progress towards peace. I personally believe that so far as conflicts are properly dealt
 with, competitive sports could be a prominent platform that furthers exchange and
 understanding across the world.
 Given that competitive sports are entangled with economic and political interests, it
 is safe to say that it could spark conflict of interests among different groups,
 especially among different nations. When there is a lack of effective regulation,
 competition in sports is likely to end up in a scenario where one side is trying to
 dominate the other side with force or even exploitation. On the individual level,
 competitive sports might result in fans brawl where some irrational sports fans get
 upset about the results and vent their anger on others.
 On the other hand, international competitive sports are also believed to have created
 an important space for cultural exchange across the world. Sports turn out to be a
 major channel through which we make friends with others whom otherwise we might
 never meet. On top of that, sports are an integration of a regional economic, political
 and cultural history, hence they are a key window that furthers understanding across
 different groups of people.
 As for me, I believe that overall, the benefits of competitive sports far outweigh the
 harms. Wherever there is competition, there could be conflicts, but that is not why we
 should oppose competition. So far as we cope with conflicts appropriately,
 competitive sports are immensely conducive for our economy and society.

 **参考范文**
Pop culture of clothing has reached every nook of the earth and more and more people
 grow increasingly receptive towards the idea of buying fashionable clothes. A variety
 of factors shape this particular trend, which I believe is overall negative. In this essay,
 I will delve into the specific reasons behind this trend and my stance on its negative
 effect.
  
Multiple factors contribute to making fashion an important factor in choosing clothes
 and the growing economy is one of them. Thanks to the flourishing economy, more
 and more people now find fashionable clothes affordable. More importantly, many
 people use fashion as an outlet to showcase their personal identity as well as social
 status and search for like-minded people with similar fashion taste. Meanwhile,
 clothing brands vigorously advertise their fashionable clothes, implanting the idea in
 consumers that fashion is important for everyone. Globalization also makes it possible
 to sell trendy clothes around the world, regardless of where manufacturers are located.
 When the factor of fashion becomes a primary preference among more and more
 people, traditional clothes will inevitably lose its market in the long run. While
 fashion represents the latest trend of clothing, traditional clothes have a much deeper
 and profound history behind it, which I believe is too valuable to lose. Traditional
 clothes are often coupled with distinct cultural features, which were once fashion at a
 certain point in history. Given its immense historical value, traditional clothes should
 not be obsoleted under the hit of fashion. Therefore, I believe that it is a negative
 trend for consumers to put more and more importance on fashion when choosing
 clothes.

 **参考范文：**
In recent years, there has been a growing trend among people to purchase products
 such as clothes, cars, and various items that are associated with famous brand names.
 This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors. In my opinion, while there are
 both advantages and disadvantages to this trend, I believe it is mostly a negative
 development.
 One of the main reasons why people prefer buying branded items is the perceived
 quality and status associated with them. Famous brands often invest heavily in
 research and development, ensuring the superior quality and durability of their
 products. Consumers tend to believe that by purchasing these branded items, they are
 guaranteed better performance and longer lifespan. Moreover, possessing branded
 products has become a symbol of status and wealth, reflecting an individual's social
 standing and success in society.
  
Another reason for this preference is the influence of advertising and media. These
 famous brands extensively promote their products through various channels, such as
 television, social media, and celebrity endorsements. The constant exposure to these
 advertisements creates an aspiration within individuals to own such products, fueling
 the desire for branded items. Furthermore, the media often portrays ownership of
 these products as indicators of personal achievement, leading people to believe that
 owning branded items can enhance their self-esteem and overall happiness.
 However, despite these apparent benefits, I believe this trend is largely negative.
 Firstly, the high prices associated with branded items create a financial burden for
 many individuals. People often end up spending more than they can afford in order to
 possess these products, leading to increased personal debt and financial instability.
 This excessive consumerism perpetuates a materialistic culture where acquiring
 possessions becomes the primary measure of success, diverting attention from more
 important aspects of life, such as personal growth and relationships.
 Moreover, the pursuit of branded items promotes a culture of superficiality and
 conformity. People are inclined to judge others based on the brands they wear or carry,
 which fosters a sense of societal division and discrimination. This obsession with
 external appearances undermines the value of inner qualities and personal
 achievements, ultimately eroding the collective values of a society.
 In conclusion, while there are some valid reasons why people prefer purchasing
 products bearing famous brand names, I believe this trend is predominantly negative.
 The focus on material possessions and the associated costs outweigh the benefits,
 leading to financial strain and an emphasis on superficiality. It is crucial for
 individuals and society as a whole to prioritize personal growth, relationships, and
 genuine accomplishments over the mere ownership of branded products.

 **参考范文**
Shopping habits can be influenced by various factors, including age, gender, income,
 education, and cultural background. However, among these factors, age seems to be
 the most significant determinant of shopping habits. I strongly agree that people's
 shopping habits depend more on the age group they belong to than any other factors.
 Younger generations tend to be more tech-savvy and prefer to shop online. They also
 prioritize convenience and speed over the traditional shopping experience. On the
 other hand, older generations value quality, personal interaction, and face-to-face
 shopping. They are also more likely to be loyal to particular brands and stores.
  
Furthermore, age affects people's preferences and needs, which directly influence
 their shopping behaviors. For example, young adults may prioritize fashion and
 trendy items over practicality and durability, while older adults may value comfort
 and functionality over style. Similarly, parents with young children may prioritize
 safety and affordability when shopping for their families.
 However, it is important to note that shopping habits are not solely determined by age,
 and other factors such as income, education, and cultural background can also play a
 role. For instance, people with higher incomes may have more purchasing power and
 be more likely to shop for luxury items, regardless of their age.
 In conclusion, while age is an important factor in determining shopping habits, it is
 not the only factor. Nonetheless, businesses and retailers should take into account the
 age of their target consumers when designing marketing strategies and products, as it
 can greatly influence their success.

  **参考范文**
It is quite common for international organizations to provide poor countries with aids
 these days. Some people think financial support is more important than sending
 talents or giving advice. I believe that these aids are equally important and they
 should be combined together.
  
Loans and other financial aids given directly to developing countries can effectively
 solve the problems that less developed countries confronted in the short term. For
 example, material aids can effectively cope with some emergencies such as natural
 disasters like famine and diseases. But it may pose a threat to the society and bring
 numerous related problems including corruptions. Countries that receive funds on a
 regular basis are likely to rely on the financing. Besides, authorities may take
 advantage of this and even embezzle the money. In the end, people in developing
 countries cannot enjoy the benefit of these financial aids.
 Talents and advice, on the other hand, may make greater contributions. International
 organizations can send talented staff like outstanding teachers to give local people
 opportunities to receive high-level education and find well-paid jobs in the future.
 The positive effects can be seen in the long term and they are long-lasting. The
 well-educated workforce will break their country’s reliance on financial aid from
 international organizations and boost their economy independently.
 I firmly believe both aids are equally important to people in less developed countries
 and impoverished regions. International groups can support these financially
 struggling countries with funds when they are suffering from urgent social problems.
 While talents and advice can bring more sustainable economy to these vulnerable
 areas. Taking corn planting as an example, developing countries can make corn their
 sustainable food source by learning how to plant it.

 **参考范文**
Nowadays, it is so common for global brands to sponsor sports events as a way to
 draw as much attention as possible. While sponsorship in sports events certainly
 generate profits, it can also exert negative impacts on brands, sports and audiences. I
 personally believe that advertisement is an indispensable part of sports and when
 properly regulated, advertisers and sports events can positively supplement one
 another.
 There is no denying that advertisements make up a huge sum of funding that sustains
 the development of sports events. Sponsorship on venues, TV commercials, jerseys
 and shoes often contribute loads of money that could be invested on optimizing sports
 facilities and further expanding the influence of sports. More importantly, when there
 is decent or even lucrative advertisement revenue, more talents are likely to be drawn
 into sports, which is definitely conducive for sports development.
 As for the downsides of advertisements in sports, some argue that they negatively
 affect viewing experience as the audience has to bear seconds or even minutes of
 monotonous advertisements every once in a while before they could get back to the
 live broadcasting of the games. On top of that, when there is a lack of scrutiny,
 ill-designed advertisements, such as those that promote poisonous products, could
 create a ripple effect and damage the image of sports events. Moreover, some
 advertisements contain violent, graphic and disturbing content that is totally
 inappropriate for young audience.
 The reason why I think advertisement is an indispensable part of sports despite its
 many drawbacks is that it provides the necessary funding for sports events to run
 sustainably so that fans can always have access to enjoyable games. There are many
 measures that governments can resort to, including financial and legal penalties, in
 order to regulate advertisements. When well-regulated, advertisements can greatly
 expand the influence of sports around the world.

 **参考范文：**
There are several reasons why young people today are not inclined to spend their
 holidays and weekends participating in outdoor activities such as hiking and climbing
 in nature. However, by understanding these reasons and implementing certain
 strategies, we can encourage them to engage in these activities.
 One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the increasing reliance on
 technology. Nowadays, young people are more likely to spend their free time on
 electronic devices, such as smartphones, video games, and social media. These
 activities provide instant gratification and entertainment, making them more appealing
 than outdoor activities that require physical effort and patience.
 Another factor is the changing lifestyles and priorities of young people. Many are
 burdened with academic pressure or busy schedules due to extracurricular activities
  
and part-time jobs. As a result, they may not have the time or energy to explore
 outdoor activities. Moreover, the emphasis on academic achievements and career
 prospects leaves little room for leisure pursuits.
 To encourage young people to go outdoors, we would need to adopt proactive
 measures. Firstly, educational institutions should incorporate outdoor activities into
 their curriculum. By incorporating adventure-based learning and outdoor excursions,
 students can learn to appreciate the benefits of outdoor activities and develop a
 connection with nature. This can instill a lifelong interest in exploring the outdoors.
 Furthermore, parents, guardians, and schools should actively promote the benefits of
 outdoor activities. They should highlight the physical and mental health advantages of
 engaging in such activities, emphasizing the opportunity to disconnect from
 technology and enjoy the beauty of nature. By creating awareness and fostering a
 positive attitude towards outdoor activities, we can inspire young people to step
 outside their comfort zones.
 Government support is also crucial in encouraging outdoor activities among the youth.
 The authorities should invest in the development of parks, hiking trails, and climbing
 facilities. They can organize outdoor events, and sports competitions to create a sense
 of community and excitement around these activities.
 The authorities should invest in the development of parks, hiking trails, and climbing
 facilities. They can organize outdoor events, workshops, and sports competitions to
 create a sense of community and excitement around these activities. Additionally,
 subsidies or discounts can be provided for outdoor equipment rentals to reduce
 financial barriers.
 In conclusion, the decline in young people participating in outdoor activities can be
 attributed to technological distractions and changing priorities. To encourage them to
 go out, we must integrate outdoor activities into education, promote the benefits of
 these pursuits, and provide necessary infrastructure and support. By doing so, we can
 inspire a generation of young people to appreciate nature and reap the rewards of
 outdoor adventures.

 **参考范文**
In today's fast-paced world, many people living in cities lead sedentary lifestyles,
 which often lead to health problems. This is due to various factors, including the lack
 of exercise facilities in urban areas, limited time due to long working hours, and the
 preference for convenience over physical activity.
 One of the main causes of the lack of physical exercise among city dwellers is the
 limited availability of exercise facilities. Many cities do not have enough parks or
 recreational centers, and some neighborhoods lack sidewalks or bike lanes, making it
 difficult for people to walk or cycle to work or school. Additionally, people often
 have busy schedules that leave little time for physical exercise. Many people have to
 work long hours to make ends meet, leaving them with little energy or motivation to
 engage in physical activity.
  
To address this problem, several solutions can be implemented. City planners can
 prioritize the construction of parks and recreation facilities and design walkable and
 bike-friendly neighborhoods. Employers can also encourage their workers to exercise
 by providing on-site gyms or organizing group fitness activities during lunch breaks
 or after work hours. Furthermore, individuals can choose to prioritize exercise by
 setting aside time for it, such as waking up earlier to jog or bike to work.
 In conclusion, the lack of physical exercise among people living in cities is a serious
 problem that can lead to various health issues. Addressing this issue will require a
 collaborative effort from city planners, employers, and individuals, and implementing
 solutions such as building exercise facilities, promoting active commuting, and
 making time for exercise.

 **参考范文**
In recent years, an increasing number of developing countries have been expanding
 their tourist industries. This trend can be attributed to several factors, including the
 potential economic benefits that come with increased tourism. While this can be seen
 as a positive development, there are also potential drawbacks to consider.
 One reason why developing countries are expanding their tourist industries is that it
 can be a significant source of income. With the rise of low-cost airlines and online
 booking platforms, travel has become more accessible and affordable for many people.
 This has led to an increase in the number of tourists traveling to developing countries,
 which can bring in revenue from hotel bookings, restaurants, transportation, and other
 related services.
 Additionally, tourism can create jobs and boost local economies. Many tourist
 destinations require a range of services, such as hotels, restaurants, and tour operators,
 which can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. This can have a positive impact
  
on the lives of people living in the area, providing opportunities for work and income.
 However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, increased
 tourism can put a strain on local resources and infrastructure. Popular tourist
 destinations may struggle to cope with the influx of visitors, leading to issues such as
 overcrowding, environmental degradation, and strain on public services.
 Furthermore, there is the risk of cultural exploitation. In some cases, tourism can lead
 to the commodification of local cultures, with tourists expecting to be entertained and
 catered to in a certain way. This can lead to the exploitation of local traditions and
 practices for the benefit of tourism, rather than preserving and respecting them.
 In conclusion, while the expansion of the tourist industry in developing countries can
 bring potential economic benefits, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks
 as well. Governments and local communities should work to manage tourism in a
 sustainable way, balancing the benefits with the need to protect local resources,
 cultures, and infrastructure.

 **参考范文**
Vegetarianism is a lifestyle that some people believe everyone should adhere to. The
 reason why they believe in that is that we can stay healthy without eating meat. On
 that note, I strongly disagree, as I am convinced that eating meat could be a
 wholesome and enjoyable lifestyle for many people and that everyone is entitled to
 choose the way to live that fits their needs.
 Meat can be more nutritious than vegetables for many people in certain ways. As
 scientific research finds out, meat supplies people with protein and vitamins that
 cannot be found in vegetables. In addition, people cannot find certain vital nutrients,
 including iron, zinc, calcium and iodine, in vegetables. Meanwhile, meat could be a
 healthy choice of food that prevents people from ailments such as anemia and
 dementia. If people adopt a long-term meat-free lifestyle, their immunity system
 could be undermined to an extent that they would frequently get sick.
 Besides, for many people, eating could be more than a way for them to keep fit. In
 fact, eating might be an enjoyable experience. Vegetables do not share the taste of
 meat and therefore, many people cannot find the same experience of eating meat in
 vegetables. Eating proves to one of the major ways to improve our sense of
 well-being, so if eating meat can make some people happier and it does not damage
 the environment to a severe extent, the society should not intervene with their choice
 of what to eat.
 Indeed, vegetables can, in some ways, compliment or even replace some nutritious
 values of meat, but with no doubt, for a certain group of people, meat can provide
 them with vital nutrition that significantly improves their physical conditions.
 Therefore, despite the fact that eating too much meat could pose risks of health, it
 should be up to people to consider whether or not vegetarianism fits their needs.

In ourmodern society, the availability of entertainment options has significantly
 increased.Withtheriseof technology,playingelectronicgamesonportabledevices
 has become a popular formof entertainment. However, there is ongoing debate
 regarding the potential harm these gamesmay impose on individuals and their
 societies. Inthisessay,Iwilldiscusstheextent towhichIagreeordisagreewiththe
statement that the availability of entertainment like playing electronic games on
 portable devices is harmful to individuals in the society they live in.
 One argument in favor of the idea that playing electronic games on portable devices is
 harmful is that it can lead to various health issues. Excessive screen time and
 sedentary behavior can contribute to obesity, eye strain, and musculoskeletal problems.
 Moreover, individuals who spend excessive amounts of time playing games might
 neglect important aspects of their lives, such as social interactions, education, and
 professional responsibilities. This could result in social isolation, poor academic
 performance, and reduced career prospects.
 On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that playing electronic games on
 portable devices can also have positive effects on individuals. These games can
 provide cognitive benefits, such as improving problem-solving skills, strategic
 thinking, and hand-eye coordination. Additionally, certain games require teamwork
 and cooperation, fostering social skills and enhancing communication abilities.
 Furthermore, playing games can serve as a stress-relieving activity, allowing
 individuals to temporarily escape from the pressures of daily life.
 Turning to the impact on society, some argue that the availability of entertainment like
 electronic games can lead to negative consequences. Excessive gaming might
 contribute to a decline in productivity and motivation among individuals, particularly
 in the younger generation. Moreover, it is claimed that violent or addictive games can
 potentially influence individuals' behavior, leading to aggression, desensitization to
 violence, and addictive tendencies. Such societal implications should not be
 overlooked when considering the harmful effects of playing electronic games on
 portable devices.
 In conclusion, it is clear that playing electronic games on portable devices possesses
 both potential harms and benefits for individuals and their societies. Therefore, it is
 essential to strike a balance between enjoying entertainment and maintaining a
 healthy lifestyle, and individuals should exercise self-discipline in managing their
 time spent on electronic games.

In recent years, the trend of conducting business meetings and training sessions online
 has gained popularity. While some argue that this development has its drawbacks, I
 believe that the advantages of this approach far outweigh the disadvantages.
 Firstly, online meetings and training sessions save a lot of time and money. It
 eliminates the need for participants to travel long distances to attend meetings or
 training sessions, which not only saves travel time but also reduces traffic-related
 expenses. Additionally, online meetings and training sessions can be recorded and
 shared with those who were unable to attend, which helps these people further save
 their time and money.
 Secondly, online meetings and training sessions provide flexibility and convenience.
 Participants can attend from anywhere in the world, at any time that suits them,
 making it easier to schedule meetings and training sessions. Online meetings and
 training sessions can also be conducted from the comfort of one's home or office,
 which provides a more relaxed and comfortable learning environment.
 However, there are some disadvantages to online meetings and training sessions. One
 of the main drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction. It can be more
 challenging to build relationships and establish trust with colleagues or clients when
  
interactions are limited to virtual environments. Additionally, technical issues such as
 poor internet connectivity or malfunctioning equipment can hinder the effectiveness
 of online meetings and training sessions.
 In conclusion, while online meetings and training sessions have some disadvantages, I
 believe that their advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. The convenience and
 flexibility that they provide, along with the cost and time savings, make them a
 valuable tool for modern businesses. However, it is crucial to ensure that they are
 used appropriately and that efforts are made to overcome any potential drawbacks to
 maximize their benefits.

The development of technology has transformed the way we access and consume
 information. More and more people are now using computers and electric devices
 such as smartphones and tablets to read books, magazines, and newspapers. In my
 opinion, while the shift to digital information has many benefits, there is still a need to
 print books, magazines, and newspapers on paper.
 One advantage of digital information is that it is more accessible and convenient. With
 the internet, people can access information from anywhere in the world, and with the
 use of smartphones and tablets, they can carry an extensive library with them
 wherever they go. This makes it easier for people to read, learn, and stay informed.
 However, there are still some disadvantages to digital information. One of the
 significant disadvantages is the fact that not everyone has access to technology or the
  
internet, particularly in developing countries where access to technology is limited. In
 addition, digital information can be fleeting and easily lost. For example, if a person's
 device is lost or damaged, they may lose all the information they have saved on it.
 Furthermore, there is still value in the physical form of books, magazines, and
 newspapers. Physical copies are tangible and can be kept as keepsakes or passed
 down to future generations. Reading a physical book or magazine can also be a more
 immersive experience, and the act of turning pages can be satisfying.
 In conclusion, while digital information is becoming more prevalent, there is still a
 need for printed books, magazines, and newspapers. Both forms of information have
 their advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to individuals to choose which format
 works best for them.

Electronic gadgets like mobile phones or computers have become an integral part of
 our lives and it is now impossible to imagine a life without them. Some people,
 however, argue that the abusive use of them could have an adverse impact on the
 youngsters’ literacy skills. I agree with this view for several reasons, which I will
 explore in the following essay.
 To begin with, the youth now are so addicted to using their cells to interact and chat
 with their friends. This whole process can take up a whole day without making them
  
feel tired or bored, so they would naturally have no time for any reading.
 Consequently, their reading skills will be greatly degraded.
 Moreover, the youngsters tend to only use acronyms when sending messages to their
 friends. As a result, many of them do not know the spelling of even common words.
 In addition, they usually use emojis to express their emotions. While it might look
 harmless, it can actually affect their ability to communicate feelings in words. What’s
 more, most word processors now have spell-checks. Since these programs
 automatically correct the spelling of misspelled words, these young people might not
 have to learn spelling to get good marks.
 However, for those who know how to take advantage of these communication tools,
 there might be fewer negative effects. Some smart users use their cells to search for
 useful research materials and read them whenever they have some free time, which is
 beneficial for their study and future career.
 In sum, the over-indulgence on technological devices can definitely do great harm to
 young people’s reading and writing skills. However, since the prevalence of these
 things can not be changed, right habits must be developed to gain the positive effects.

In recent years, the fear of crime has become a deterrent for many individuals to
 venture outside their homes. While some argue that more stringent measures should
 be implemented to prevent crimes, others believe that there is a limit to what can be
 done. This essay will discuss both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.
 On the one hand, those who advocate for stronger actions argue that there are various
 measures that can be taken to combat crime effectively. Firstly, increasing police
 presence in public areas can help deter criminals and enhance public safety.
 Additionally, the installation and use of surveillance cameras can aid in identifying
 and apprehending offenders, thus reducing crime rates. Moreover, enhancing
 community engagement and implementing educational programs that raise awareness
 about crime prevention can empower individuals to protect themselves and their
 communities.
 On the other hand, some individuals hold the view that despite efforts to prevent
 crimes, there will always be criminal activities occurring in society. They argue that as
 long as the root causes of crime, such as poverty, inequality, and social exclusion,
 exist, it is near impossible to make a significant impact on crime prevention.
  
In my opinion, while it is necessary to implement measures to prevent crimes, it is
 equally important to address the underlying causes that lead individuals to engage in
 criminal activities. Prevention strategies should focus not only on law enforcement,
 but also on social and economic factors. By addressing issues such as poverty and
 inequality, societies can create an environment that is less conducive to criminal
 behavior. Furthermore, education and awareness programs should be prioritized to
 empower individuals to protect themselves and their communities.
 To conclude, the fear of crime has resulted in some individuals being reluctant to
 leave their homes. Although it is essential to take action to prevent crimes, addressing
 the root causes and providing equal opportunities can also contribute to a safer society.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach that combines effective law enforcement
 measures with social and economic initiatives is needed to tackle the issue of crime
 effectively.

 **参考范文**
The debate over whether police should carry guns has been a contentious issue for
 many years. Some argue that carrying guns will encourage a higher level of violence
 in society, while others contend that it is necessary for officers to be armed to protect
 themselves and the public.
 One argument against police carrying guns is that it can escalate the level of violence
 in potentially dangerous situations. If police officers feel threatened or nervous, they
 may be more likely to use their weapons, even if the situation does not warrant such
 force. Additionally, if police carry guns, it could make the public feel more fearful and
 distrustful of law enforcement, undermining the ability of police to carry out their
 duties effectively.
 On the other hand, there are several reasons why police officers should be armed.
 First, it provides officers with a means of protecting themselves and the public from
 violent criminals. Second, it can act as a deterrent to would-be offenders, as they
  
know that the police are capable of using force to protect themselves and the public.
 Finally, it can give officers an advantage in dangerous situations, where quick and
 decisive action is required to protect the public.
 In my opinion, police officers should be allowed to carry guns, but only after proper
 training and certification. Officers need to be trained to use their weapons responsibly
 and only in situations that require such force. Additionally, there should be strict
 regulations in place to ensure that officers do not abuse their power or use excessive
 force.
 In conclusion, while the issue of police carrying guns is complex, it is important to
 strike a balance between protecting officers and the public and ensuring that law
 enforcement is carried out in a fair and responsible manner.

In today's society, there is a growing emphasis on the value of good social skills in
 addition to qualifications when it comes to employment. While some argue that
 qualifications alone should be sufficient, others believe that social skills play a crucial
 role in professional success. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and present my
 opinion on this matter.
 On one hand, proponents of focusing solely on qualifications argue that academic
 achievements and technical expertise are essential for job performance. They believe
 that qualifications demonstrate an individual's knowledge and competence in a
 specific field, making them better equipped to handle job responsibilities.
 Furthermore, they argue that technical skills can be objectively measured and
 evaluated, ensuring that employers make informed hiring decisions based on merit
 rather than subjective judgments.
  
On the other hand, those who emphasize the importance of social skills argue that
 they are crucial in promoting effective communication and collaboration within the
 workplace. Possessing good social skills enables individuals to build positive
 relationships with colleagues, clients, and superiors, fostering teamwork and
 cooperation. Moreover, strong interpersonal skills contribute to effective
 problem-solving and conflict resolution, leading to a more productive work
 environment. Additionally, individuals with good social skills are often perceived as
 more approachable, creating a positive and welcoming atmosphere within an
 organization.
 In my opinion, I agree that employing individuals with good social skills in addition
 to qualifications is of paramount importance. While qualifications provide the
 necessary foundation, social skills enhance an individual's overall effectiveness in the
 workplace. Technical expertise may help someone excel in their specific role, but
 social skills enable them to thrive within a team and contribute positively to the
 organizational culture. Interpersonal skills are particularly crucial in industries that
 require frequent interactions with clients or involve working in teams.
 Ultimately, a balance between qualifications and social skills should be sought when
 considering potential employees. Employers should not overlook the importance of
 qualifications, but they should also recognize that social skills contribute significantly
 to an individual's professional success and overall effectiveness within an
 organization. Striking a balance can lead to a harmonious and productive work
 environment.
 To conclude, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, social skills should be
 given equal importance in the employment process. By valuing individuals' abilities
 to communicate, collaborate, and build relationships, organizations can create a
 positive and productive work environment that fosters both personal growth and
 professional success.

According to a lot of businesses, many college students nowadays demonstrate the
 lack of interpersonal skills in their cooperation with colleagues and participation in
 teamwork. Students might be active and outgoing on campus but once they hit the
 workforce, they tend to become more introverted and reluctant to communicate.
 One of the primary reasons why new recruits appear to be poor in communicating and
 partnering with others in workplace is that most students socialized within the same
 group for a very long time. For example, students make friends in school and hang out
 together from time to time throughout their whole college life. Most new graduates
 are used to staying in their comfort zone of the old social network even when they
 start a new phase of life. They get uncomfortable when they step into the workplace
 for the first time and cannot simply pluck up the courage to develop new interpersonal
 relationships and team up with others, resulting in little communication and low
 efficiency.
 After clarifying the problem, I would like to suggest some possible solutions to it. In
 most cases, new graduates are not introverted in nature. They just need a little bit
 catalyst for change. What companies can do is to provide them with opportunities to
 fit in and develop good relationships with others, such as organizing orientations and
 group activities. The students themselves also need to realize that they are no longer
 with the known crowd of his peer friends and family. What they need to do is just as
 simple as to seek advice from a senior or to give a hand to a someone being tied up in
 his/her work.
 In conclusion, new graduates lack interpersonal skills because they are used to the old
 circles and old life modes refuse to make active changes. But in fact, once taking a
 step out of their comfort zones, most of them can successfully become communicative
 and cooperative contributors to the team.

### 1.education

What we should not ignore is that education is one of the most important things in our life.Investing in education will benefit us in the long run.
 
For students, they can get access to knowledge,grasp skills, develop communicative ability, even then stimulate learning interests and motivation, expand their potential.

As we all know, Chinese education is divided into three stages, primary education, secondary education and university education.
  
In primary education, we have a variety of collective activity to cultivate morality and virtue, distinguish right from wrong and shape a positive word view for nurture law-abiding citizens. In the meantime, role models will have a positive influence on everyone even if they are selfish and egocentric.

In secondary education, the student-centred teaching approach has become mainstream.
We give their individuality full respect. 
In spite of outstanding or inferior, diligent or indolent, obedient or disobedient, we will instruct each student and give them personalized teaching.
Additionally, students should spare no effort to raise the level of literacy and learn the theoretical knowledge greedily.

In high education, vocational training with career-orienten educational mode is not neglected because they will apply the knowledge into practice and compete with their peers to obtain decent and well- paid jobs. Therefore they must place emphasis on strengthening their comprehensive skills to become inter-disciplinary talent.
